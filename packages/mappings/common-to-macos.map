# Package name mappings from common.txt to macOS/Homebrew package names
# Format: common-name=brew-package-name

# Most packages in common.txt have the same name in Homebrew
# This file exists for consistency but may be mostly empty

# No mappings needed currently - Homebrew names match common names
