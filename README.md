## Installation
You will want to make sure you install the following applications

- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Git
- Curl

### Cloning the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrock2004/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

cd ~/.dotfiles

# To see what options to pass into install run the following:
./install.sh

# Then run what you want
./install.sh all
```

## Inspiration

My inspiration of my dotfiles comes from [Nick Nisi](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles).
Thank you for showing me the way
