My Dotfiles
=

This repo is used to store my dotfiles for the applications that I use on my machine

## Branches
- master - Bash on Windows
- linux - Used when you are running Linux [Debian based, tested on elementary os]
- mac - Used on Apple [Tested on El Capitan]
- bashonwindows - Bash on Windows

## Pre-req
You need to just install git so you can clone the repo

## How to use
To use this, its pretty simple. Clone this to ~/.dotfiles. Switch to the branch you need, see above. Open the following file and edit the variables on the top of the file to match what you want

```
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

After you save that, make sure you are in the .dotfiles directory and run the following command

```
$ ./install.sh
```

## Thanks
I did not build this from scratch. I had help and started with a template. Thanks Nick Nisi(https://github.com/nicknisi)
