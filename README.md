# dotfiles
Just like every other developer out there I am putting my dotfiles out there.
Have to give a shout out to https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles as this is now being built like his

### Requirements
The only requirement is you will need to install Xcode. The full version not just
the command line tools

### Prop
This rebuild is in thanks to [Nick Nisi]. His repo has given me the will to build
mine just like he did
