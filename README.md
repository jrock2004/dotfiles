My Dotfiles
=

This repo is used to store my dotfiles for the applications that I use on my machine

## Branches
- master - Bash on Windows
- mac - Used on Apple [Tested on El Capitan]

## Pre-req
You need to just install git so you can clone the repo

## How to use
To use this, its pretty simple. Clone this to ~/.dotfiles. Open the following file and edit the variables to match what you want

```
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

After you edit that, go into the .dotfiles directory and run the following command

```
$ ./install.sh
```

## Thanks
I did not build this from scratch. I had help and started with a template. Thanks Nick Nisi(https://github.com/nicknisi)
