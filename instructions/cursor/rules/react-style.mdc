description: React component conventions
globs:
  - '**/*.{ts,tsx}'
---

- Functional components + hooks only; follow hooks rules.
- Components small, semantic, accessible.
- Naming: PascalCase components/types; camelCase vars/functions; ALL_CAPS constants.
- Import order: React → libraries → local modules → types → styles.
