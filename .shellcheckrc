# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles project
# See: https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Disable SC2155 - Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# While this is a good practice, it makes the code more verbose without significant benefit
# in our use case. We handle errors with set -e and proper error handling.
disable=SC2155

# Disable SC1091 - Not following sourced files
# Our scripts source library files that exist at runtime but may not be found
# during static analysis. We verify these files exist in integration tests.
disable=SC1091

# Disable SC2034 for library files that define variables for external use
# These variables are intentionally defined for sourcing by other scripts
# (colors, symbols, configuration variables, etc.)
disable=SC2034

# Disable SC2086 - Double quote to prevent globbing
# In many cases in our scripts, we intentionally use unquoted variables
# where the context is safe (seq, basename, etc.)
disable=SC2086

# Disable SC2059 - Don't use variables in printf format string
# Our UI library uses color variables in format strings, which is intentional
# and safe in our controlled environment
disable=SC2059

# Disable SC2129 - Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file
# This is a style preference. Individual redirects are more readable in our scripts
disable=SC2129

# Note: We keep most other checks enabled to maintain code quality
# Any disabled checks should be documented here with justification
